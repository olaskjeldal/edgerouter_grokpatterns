# edgerouter grokpatterns for use in logstash

found some starting patterns off reddit (archived original post at https://m.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/3mkr85/syslog_message_format_for_uap/) and thought i would share my progress on working with them for logging edgerouters to logstash...

apply the contents of the logstash-grokfilter	file to a grok filter with the custom-patterns file loaded in your logstash configuration file(s).

Enjoy !
